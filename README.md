I am a computer science co-op student attending Toronto Metropolitan University (formerly Ryerson University). 
I am eager to learn more about developing video games and artificial intelligence technologies.
I have a strong understanding of Java, Python, Bash, Lisp, C, C++, Smalltalk/Pharo, Haskell, Elixir, Rust, Visual Basic, HTML, CSS, Javascript, Git, and I have also dabbled in Unity Engine, C#, and Lua
I am also full of curiosity to learn more about coding whenever I have the opportunity to.
